## Kerri's notes
* There's still a lot to work on in this app - I couldn't quite get the stubbing right when testing the output of the computer's sample of rock, paper and scissors
* I also struggled to implement a way to display the outcome of the game win/lose/draw, so it will be a work in progress for now
* Otherwise, all tests passing so far with high test coverage, no issues flagged by rubocop and the game is running smoothly in the browser
